Guides for getting things done in Jira.

* [Client Services: Creating Tickets](/jira/client_services_ticket_creation.md)
* [Client Services: Completing Tickets](/jira/client_services_ticket_actions.md)

## General Tips

**Tickets**

> In addition to the usual fields, also add:

* Due date
* Labels (if applicable)

**Epics**

* In general, create epics such that they have a defined lifecyle. They are opened,
features are developed, then they are completed (Done).
* Maximum of 10 issues assigned to single Epic.

**Estimates**
* Tasks - the `Original Estimate` value should be a combined total including all subtasks.
* Subtasks - add value for `Original Estimate`.
* Estimate values should be the time you expect to work on the given task (not including
time waiting for other parties that may be blocking the task)

**Assignee**
* Once assignee has been assigned, please don't change it. Rather, create a sub-task
and assign it to another developer who may be taking it over.

**Story vs. Task**
* For BAU, use a task.
* For a new Feature, use a story.

**Logging Time**
* At the end of each day, time spend on tickets should be logged to the applicable
story / task.
* When pair programming, the 'navigator(s) / passenger(s)' should log their time
to the ticket of the 'driver'.
