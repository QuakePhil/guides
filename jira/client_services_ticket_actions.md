# Ticket Action Guidelines for Client Services

After work has been completed on a ticket and it's ready to be tested, the ticket will be moved to "Test in QA"

When this happens, you need to:

 - Focus on testing what is described on the title of the task
 - Look for the last comment on the ticket. Many times, the Project Manager (PM) will provide you a script of what
 exactly needs to be tested pertaining to this ticket.
 - If the functionality described in the ticket is present and working correctly, or if the bug described is no longer
 present, the task should be moved into "Ready."
 - If the functionality described in the ticket is NOT present or is not working correctly, or if the bug described is
 still present, you may reopen it and assign it back to the original developer. A comment here is generally helpful as
 well.

During the process of testing a ticket in "Test in QA," if you find an issue in some other area of the application that
has nothing to do with the ticket at hand, do the following:

 - Follow the steps to create a Bug or Task, depending on the issue you have found.
 - If the functionality presented in the current ticket is working as expected, it should be moved to "Ready."
